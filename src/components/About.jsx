        Hi, I'm a self-taught frontend developer with a strong passion for React
        and a growing interest in the world of AI. I've always been driven to
        learn and improve, which has led me to spend most of my days tinkering
        with code, and exploring new technologies
        <br />
        When I'm not coding, I like to experiment with new recipes in the
        kitchen and enjoy cooking for my friends and family. I'm also a big
        music fan and enjoy exploring new artists and genres. And, in my free
        time,
